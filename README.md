# Team_work

# Here we first Divide Our Project into 5 classes:
 
1 - class for the Track sound.
2 - class for the Track List.
3 - class for the Controls of the Programm

# The remaining 2 classes :

 # one of them is AbstractBaseClass:

    # it inherites from (tkinter.Frames)class
  
    # with two methods 

        1- __creat Frame.
        2- __creat Widget.
 
    # We can't use hidden(private)method 
     as abstract method,because it will raise an error..
  
    # that 3 classes :
        1 - class For the Sound Track.
        2 - class For the Track List.
        3 - class For the Controls of the Programm
        
          inherit from.
  
 # The last Class is named Player(Sound Track,Track List,Controls)
 
  that inherites all methods and attributes from the 3 classes , and in which we call the methods created in the other 3 classes ......
